    want.

3. Make sure that you enter the directory where you
    pasted the 'CSC Project' folder in your system,
    when the program asks for it at the beginning of
    execution.

4. When entering the directory, type '\\' between
    folders, and do not type anything after the last folder,
    i.e, the folder in which you have pasted the 'CSC 
    Project' folder.
